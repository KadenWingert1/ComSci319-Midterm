                During the recent pandemic, I went to the Bridger Forge shop with my
                friend ,Colton, to learn how to make knives, he let me use his shop to
                make and sell my own creations. And without him my life would not be
                what it is today. Colton decided to make me his apprentice, and ever
                since then I have continued to make progress with his teachings. We plan
                on expanding our businesses and our names in this trade.

                At a young age, I fell in love with medieval fantasy. Especially with
                the swords. There was always something about blades that attracted me.
                I loved the artistry behind it. Every blade has a symbolic meaning, as
                if they are sacred. For example in Europe, the English swords were
                designed to resemble the cathedral. With my love for blades, and sheer
                luck. I became lucky enough to find this passion.

                Ever since I was 13 I decided to start lifting weights. Throughout the
                years of strict eating, building up my mental fortitude and
                determination. I eventually decided to compete in bodybuilding shows.
                My third show, I met Colton Arias. Luck tends to follow hard work. And
                I was definitely lucky to meet Colton. I had just bought my own forge
                back home a few weeks before that show. Got talking backstage with him
                about bladesmithing and telling him that. He mentioned that he was
                going on Forged In Fire in a few weeks. He ended up winning his first
                champion title. We kept in touch throughout that year, we both
                transitioned into college. We got chatting about bodybuilding and how
                I wanted him to join my team Awaken the Warrior. He ended up driving
                three hours to where I was going to college at the time. We found out
                that we have way to much in common and became best friends, if not
                brothers. Later went up to my coaches gym and he eventually joined the
                team. As the months went on I took a few trips up to Lincoln to hang
                out with him. He made me a few knives and showed me how.

                Coronavirus hit the U.S. and the world stopped in place. During the
                lockdown I was doing online classes. I knew college wasn’t for me. Too
                many people go without knowing what they want, everyone ends up
                getting a safe job and they waste their lives at it. They never really
                find their passion. That wasn’t my path. I was already taking the
                unconventional route with trying to make it as a pro bodybuilder and
                having my name rise through the fitness industry. Flustered with
                myself and the direction I want my life to go. I decided to leave
                college, move to Lincoln and get a job. I went to the Bridger Forge
                shop with Colton to learn how to make knives, he let me use his shop
                to make and sell my own creations. And without him my life would not
                be what it is today. Colton decided to make me his apprentice, and
                ever since then I have continued to make progress with his teachings.
